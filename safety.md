# Safety notes (read before anything else)

## Key hazards in this recipe

- **Phosphoric acid (85%)**: corrosive, can burn skin and eyes.  
  - Use gloves + eye protection.  
  - Use acid-compatible glassware.  
  - Add acid carefully; avoid splashes.

- **Essential oils / aroma chemicals**: even when “natural,” these are **concentrated**.
  - Only use materials explicitly sold as **food-grade / flavor-grade**.
  - Never taste oils or concentrates directly.

- **Ethanol (food-grade)**: flammable.
  - Keep away from open flame, hot plates, and sparks.

## Materials guidance

- Prefer **glass** for mixing vessels when strong acid is present.
- Avoid bare metal cookware in contact with strong acids; corrosion can introduce unwanted metals.
- Label all bottles clearly and store away from children.

## If you want a safer path

Consider using a **commercial cola flavor concentrate** intended for beverage use (homebrewing / soda syrups),
then adjust sweetness and acidity within food-safe ranges. This won’t replicate the “Lab-Cola” method, but it reduces risk.
