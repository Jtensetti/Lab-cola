# Background (method overview)

The source video presents a reverse-engineering workflow:

1. Start from published cola-style recipes (citrus + brown spices + vanilla notes).
2. Run systematic sensory trials to find which oils “matter” most.
3. Use chemical analysis (GC/MS-style mass spectrometry outputs) to detect dominant volatile compounds.
4. Cross-reference a peer-reviewed aroma study in the *Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry* for quantified odorants.
5. Identify a missing non-volatile component (tannins / astringency) that is not captured well in gas-phase analysis.
6. Iterate until both the volatile fingerprint and taste tests converge.

This repo focuses on documenting the final presented recipe and its mixing workflow.
