# Lab-Cola (Recipe Reconstruction)

This repository is a *documentation-first* GitHub project that captures a well-known community recipe for a Coca-Cola–style cola (“Lab-Cola”) as presented by YouTuber **LabCoatz** in the video *Perfectly Replicating Coca Cola (It Took Me A Year)*.

**What this is:** a structured write-up of an unofficial reconstruction recipe and its rationale.  
**What this is not:** Coca-Cola’s proprietary formula, medical advice, or a guarantee of safety or legal compliance.
